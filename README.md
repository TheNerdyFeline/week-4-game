RPG using jQuery. I built a dragon role playing game, pick a dragon and defeat remaning dragons. I used jquery and boostrap to make the game. It is almost to the point I want, but you still need to hit the attack button to continue game. I need to learn how to separate the attack click function from the if/else if part.
